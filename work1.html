         During my GBDA203 course (taught by Daniel Harley), we were tasked with recording
         and documenting our usage of a piece of technology. I chose to use headphones, as
         I use them daily and cannot live without them. <br> <br>
         Headphones hold an interesting history, not being changed into everyday usage till
         Sony released the Walkman. This was siimilar to computers, so I decided to create
         the required infographic portion in a Windows 7 style. The graphic contains not
         only solid numbers, but also clever graphics to indicate each part of data. As such,
         the result is a fun yet informative graphic from observing my headphone usage. There is
         also a partner essay, which can be read <a href="shayuu09.github.io/works/full/essay-he-alex.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> if you are interested.<br> <br>
         This infographic was my first attempt at using Figma, an intuitive design software.
         The illustrations were done by myself, however I was already familiar with the
         program I used. I found myself more confident in my design skills and happy with 
         the result! It was a good learning opportunity to move away from the Adobe Suite,
         which I was already comfortable with. I believe being able to be flexible in the 
         programs and tools one uses is essential to being a designer.<br> <br>
         Numbers and charts don't need to be boring. In fact, they can be engaging while 
         still being relevant to the information portrayed. I believe this aspect will be
         crucial to continue the relationship between information and the public in the
         future.
